## Wharton Sass Boilerplate
#### A boilerplate for Sass projects using a simple 3-1 architecture pattern.

#### Overview

- base
  - the base directory is the place to keep all global related styles, including helpers.
- components
  - the components directory is the place to create styles for each part of an application. This can include layout related items (e.g., footer, header, main), to things like buttons or cards or navigation.
- library
  - the library directory is the place to put any and all third-party stylesheets.
